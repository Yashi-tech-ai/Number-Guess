# 🎲 Number Guessing Game – Python Practice Project
This is a small terminal-based game where the computer picks a random number and the user tries to guess it.

## 📚 Concepts Practiced:
- `random.randint()`
- `while` loops
- Taking and validating user input
- Giving feedback through the terminal

## ⚙️ How it Works:
- The computer selects a number between a fixed range (e.g., 1 to 100)
- You keep guessing until you get it right!
- Hints like "Too high!" or "Too low!" guide you.
